##The Problem

The migrant crisis is a worldwide issue and is especially more pressing in the Greek coasts. Every day, there are hundreds of shipwrecked boats filled with refugees that wash up on the shore - dramatic scenarios. While discussing with reporters covering the story in Lesbos, I asked what could the tech community be doing? Their answer was that the camp organizers over there are overwhelmed: "There are so many boats that we canâ€™t keep track of which ones need help. We would need a way to get alerts for passengers that are in distress."

They assured me that due to the small strip of sea separating Turkey and Lesbos migrants travelling have access to cellular network and often a smartphone along the journey and roam all the way through.

So came the idea for Lighthouse!


##The Solution

Lighthouse is a combination of a mobile app for migrants navigating and a cloud dashboard for the rescue teams on shore.

When a boat is in distress, anyone with the application downloaded on their phone can launch it a press an alert button that will send their coordinates to the closest shore station.

This station has access to a Lighthouse dashboard that monitors alerts in the filtered area. When rescue teams receive that alert, they can choose to acknowledge it - which will send a message to the migrant's mobile phone letting them know someone's coming (so they don't lose hope).

##How It's Built

*   The mobile app is developed with Ionic and AngularJS to provide a universal app for iOS, Android, Windows phone, and web access.

*   The dashboard is an AngularJS application that uses the Google Maps API to place the alerts on the map along with a filter zone (to avoid spamming)

*   All the alerts and rescue messages are sent and received using Firebase to provide a real-time communication system.

*   Built with lots of love
